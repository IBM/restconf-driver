  # another SCC is applied to the pod via a service account that doesn't support

  ## Global Docker
  ## Enable the use of a Docker Registry to pull the application Docker Image.
  ## If registry_enabled is true then the image reference will be: global.docker.registryIp:global.docker.registryPort/docker.image:docker.version
  ## Else the image reference will be: docker.image:docker.version

## Docker

  ## Affinity for pod assignment
  ## Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinity:
      ## Default anti-affinity rule is to try and schedule multiple pods of this app on different nodes
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 100
        podAffinityTerm:
          topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
          labelSelector:
            matchExpressions:
            - key: app
              operator: In
              values:
              - restconf-driver
    ## Example of node affinity rule to require this pod is only scheduled on a Node with a label (key=value) of "Stateless=True"
    #nodeAffinity:
    #  requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    #    nodeSelectorTerms:
    #    - matchExpressions:
    #      - key: Stateless

    #        values:
    #        - "True"
  ## Node tolerations for pod assignment
  ## Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/
  tolerations: []
  ## Example of allowing this pod to be deployed onto a Node that has been tainted with "ReservedForLm"
  #- key: ReservedForLm
  #  operator: Exists
  #  effect: NoSchedule
  ## JVM Options
  ## Options to pass to the JVM when running the application
  # jvmOptions: -Xmx384m
  ## Configure resource requests and limits for each container of the application
  ## Default is to have no limit
  ## NOTE: when setting the limit you should consider the -Xmx value passed in app.jvmOptions. If this is higher than the limit below then the application is likely to fail
  ## ref: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/compute-resources/
  resources: {}
    # limits:
    #  cpu: 250m
    #  memory: 384Mi
    # requests:
    #  cpu: 250m
    #  memory: 384Mi
## Service Configuration
## Define how this application is accessed internally (and potentially externally)
