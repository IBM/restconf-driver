# RESTCONF Driver for CP4NA

## Introduction

RESTCONF uses HTTP methods to provide CRUD operations on a conceptual datastore containing YANG-defined data, which is
compatible with a server that implements NETCONF datastores. The RESTCONF protocol operates on a hierarchy of resources,
starting with the top-level API resource itself.  Each resource represents a manageable component within the device.
